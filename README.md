# mres-data
The used code and data for the MRes dissertation "The Promise and Limits of Computational Integration: An Evaluation of CNV-Based Matching for Genomic and Transcriptomic Data at Single-Cell Resolution."
## scRNA-seq preprocessing
The snakemake workflow used for scRNA-seq pre-processing and CNV inference is in `scRNA_cv/`
## DEFND-seq scsWGS splitting
The snakemake workflow used to split the fastq files for scsWGS data from DEFND-seq is in `scDNA_split/`.
## Cell matching
All code for cell matching, both for cell to cell assessment and cell line to cell line assessment is in the `cell_matching/` directory. The obtained accuracies can be found in `postprocessing/accuracies/`
## Statistics and sumaries
The code used to summarise and plot the results and all statistical test on the accuracies is in `postprocessing/`. All summaries and statistical test results are in `postprocessing/statistics_and_summaries/`, all figures are in `postprocessing/figures/`
